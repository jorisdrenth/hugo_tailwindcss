# Hugo + tailwindcss playground

Since one of my colleagues is literally dreaming about tailwindcss, I've created this simple tailwindcss playground using Hugo.

## Requirements

- git
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Getting started

    git clone git@github.com:jorisdrenth/hugo_tailwindcss.git
    cd hugo_tailwindcss
    hugo server

Now visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)
Edit code in hugo_tailwindcss/layouts/index.html and see your changes live reload in your browser.
